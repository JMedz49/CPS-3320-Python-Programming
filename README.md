Python Banking Project

Intro: 
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.
Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country.
most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks.
